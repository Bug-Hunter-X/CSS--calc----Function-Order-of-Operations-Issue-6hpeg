The solution is to ensure that percentage calculations happen before any subtractions or additions. The following approach is more robust and reliable:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
  margin-left: calc(50% - 10px);
  margin-right: 10px;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
}
```

Here, we set the width to 50%, and then adjust the position using `margin-left` and `margin-right` to achieve the desired effect. This approach prevents potential order-of-operations problems within the `calc()` function. Alternatively, one might use the `transform` property for positioning the element accurately.
